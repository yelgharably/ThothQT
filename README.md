I have been deeply fascinated with the capabilities and potential of Quantum Sensors since before I was a PhD student. I have dedicated many hours and many sleepless nights outside of class time and the office to teach myself the information I need to make a meaningful contribution to quantum sensing. 

### Motivation:
Lanthanides have valence shells of the form: $[Xe]4f^{1-14}\, 5d^{0-1}\, 6s^2,$ where the $4f$ electrons are core-like. They are shielded by the filled $5s^2$ and $5p^6$ subshells. Therefore, they don't strongly participate in bonding like 3d transition-metal electrons do. However, these $4f$ states create discrete, highly localized energy levels capable of coupling weakly to their environment. This makes them ideal for long lived spin states (quantum coherence), strong and well defined magnetic moments, large Stark and Zeeman responses. Lanthanides also carry a large total angular momentum in their ions: $J=L+S$, often giving $>5\hbar$. This causes huge magnetic moments up to $10\mu B$, strong spin-orbit coupling from the $4f$ shell, and sharp $f-f$ optical transitions shielded from lattices, which often makes them excellent candidates for laser phosphors.

On a pristine pure graphene sheet, most carbon atoms arer $sp^2$-bonded and the delocalized $\pi$-electrons make it chemically inert. However, by introducing a Stone-Wales defect, some C-C bonds become unsaturated due to their higher curvature and strain, and localized states near the Fermi energy start to appear. The $4f$ electrons in Lanthanides can therefore hybridize easily with graphene's $\pi$ states through their outer $5d$ and $6s$ shells.

Basiuk et al. showed that lanthanide atoms (La to Lu on the periodic table) absorbed into a graphene Stone-Wales defect bind at the (7,7) junction $\eta^2$ coordination and short Lanthanide-C distances, producing stronger bonding and 1.5 times the charge transfer compared to pristine graphene. The $\eta$ value represents the hapicity-- the number of carbon atoms in the graphene $\pi$-system that a metal atom directly interacts with. $\eta^2$ coordination means that the lanthanide simultaneously bonds to two neighboring carbon atoms, forming two nearly equivalent Ln-C interactions. Despite the lanthanides exhbiting higher coordination numbers in molecular complexes, all Lanthanide-SW-graphene complexes in the study were found to adopt $\eta^2$ hapacity rather than $\eta^5,\,\eta^6,$ or $\eta^7$ modes typical to those bonding to pentagons, hexagons, or heptagons. 

The SW defect replaces four adjacent hexagons with two pentagon-heptagon rings-- effectively changing a (6-6-6-6) ring configuration to a (5-7-7-5) configuration. The (7,7) is where the shared C-C bond between the heptagons lives-- it's a shorter ($\approx 1.337\mathring{A}$) and more electrophilic bond compared to normnal C-C bonds in pristine graphene ($\approx 1.421\mathring{A}$). The higher electrophility makes the (7,7) junction the preferred absorption site for the lanthanide leading to stronger bonding and a higher chance of charge transfer from lanthanides to graphene. The lanthanide atom acts as a localized perturbation with adjustable onsite energies $\varepsilon$ and coupling $V$. Since lanthanides have large Stark and Zeeman responses, we believe the SW-Lanthanide configuration makes a potentially viable candidate for Electric and Magnetic fields' quantum sensors. 

Furthermore, Basiuk et al. performed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on this configuration for all of the atoms in the lanthanide series where they used finite-temperature electronic smearing during the self-consistent-field (SCF) convergence calculation. They used a smearing width of $0.02721\mathrm{~eV}$, which corresponds to $\approx 315.8\mathrm{~Kelvins,}$ and in some cases they used a smaller value of $0.00272\mathrm{~eV}$, which corresponds to $31.6\mathrm{~Kelvins}$. They explicitly emphasize that both values guarantee convergent computational results for $f$-element systems. This implies that temperature only affects the electronic smearing parameter, not the absorption thermodynamics or lattice stability. So, the $\eta^2$ coordination geometry should remains stable and temperature-independent within the range $31.6-315.8$ Kelvins. This makes the system an even more attractive quantum sensor due to its capability on operating in room temperature.
