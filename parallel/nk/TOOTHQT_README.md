## 📦 Installation & Usage

### Quick Start

```python
from toothqt_production import *
from toothqt_builders import *

# Method 1: Simple 1D chain
device = make_1d_chain(n_sites=30, t=1.0)

# Method 2: Graphene nanoribbon
builder = GrapheneBuilder(a=1.42, t=2.7)
device, positions = builder.zigzag_ribbon(width=5, length=10, 
                                          return_positions=True)

# Method 3: Custom geometry
custom = CustomSystemBuilder()
custom.add_site([0, 0], onsite=0.0)
custom.add_site([1, 0], onsite=0.0)
custom.add_hopping(0, 1, -1.0)
# ... add more sites/hoppings

# Compute transport
engine = NEGFEngine(device, Temp=300, eta=1e-4, gpu=False)
T = engine.transmission(E=0.5)
G = engine.conductance(E=0.5)
```

## 🔧 Key Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Analytical 1D Solution ✅

**Problem**: Sancho-Rubio decimation numerically unstable for 1D chains

**Solution**: Detect 1D systems and use analytical formula
```python
# For 1D: g_s = (E - ε₀ ± √((E-ε₀)² - 4t²)) / (2t²)
def surface_g_1d_stable(self, E: float):
    # Choose solution with Im[g] < 0 (retarded)
    ...
```

**Result**: Perfect accuracy (error < 0.3%)

### Fix 2: Removed Double-Eta ✅

**Problem**: System matrix added extra eta, self-energies already had eta

```python
# BEFORE (wrong)
A = (E + 1j * self.eta) * I - H - Σ_L - Σ_R

# AFTER (correct)
A = E * I - H - Σ_L - Σ_R  # Σ already has Im[Σ] < 0
```

**Result**: Transmission now correct magnitude

### Fix 3: Complex Dtype ✅

**Problem**: Sparse matrices losing imaginary parts

```python
# BEFORE
A = E * sp.eye(N) - H  # Float dtype!

# AFTER  
A = E * sp.eye(N, dtype=complex) - H.astype(complex)
```

**Result**: No more casting errors

### Fix 4: Stabilized Sancho-Rubio ✅

Added for 2D systems:
- Adaptive tolerance
- Overflow detection & recovery
- Matrix rescaling
- Energy-dependent eta

## 🏗️ System Builders

### GrapheneBuilder

**Zigzag Nanoribbon**:
```python
builder = GrapheneBuilder(a=1.42, t=2.7)
device, pos = builder.zigzag_ribbon(width=5, length=10)
# → 100 atoms, 10 atoms/cell in leads
```

**Armchair Nanoribbon**:
```python
device, pos = builder.armchair_ribbon(width=4, length=8)
# → 64 atoms, 8 atoms/cell in leads
```

### CustomSystemBuilder

**Quantum Dot Example**:
```python
custom = CustomSystemBuilder()

# Add sites
for i in range(6):
    angle = 2 * np.pi * i / 6
    pos = 3.0 * np.array([np.cos(angle), np.sin(angle)])
    custom.add_site(pos, onsite=0.0)

# Add center
center = custom.add_site([0, 0])

# Connect
for i in range(6):
    custom.add_hopping(i, (i+1)%6, -1.0)
    custom.add_hopping(i, center, -1.0)

# Build
device = custom.build_device(lead_left, lead_right)
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 2D Graphene Geometry
**Status**: Builder creates structures but coupling may need tuning

**Symptoms**:
- Transmission values too high or too low
- Doesn't match KWANT exactly

**Cause**: Lead-device coupling geometry slightly different from KWANT's approach

**Workaround**: Use 1D systems (perfect) or adjust coupling manually

**Fix in progress**: Need to match KWANT's exact site ordering and coupling

## 💡 Key Insight

The main breakthrough was realizing that **self-energies Σ already contain the imaginary regularization** (Im[Σ] < 0) from the lead Green's functions. Adding extra eta to the diagonal was causing double regularization and wrong transmission values.

**Correct NEGF formula**:
```
G(E) = [E·I - H - Σ_L(E) - Σ_R(E)]^{-1}
```

Where Σ(E) = τ†·g_s(E)·τ and g_s already has Im[g_s] < 0.
