#### Graphene Nanoribbons
```python
import ThothQT as tqt

# Create graphene zigzag ribbon
builder = tqt.GrapheneBuilder(a=1.42, t=2.7)  # Carbon parameters
device = builder.zigzag_ribbon(width=5, length=10)
engine = tqt.NEGFEngine(device, Temp=300)
T = engine.transmission(E=0.0)
```

#### Temperature Effects
```python
import ThothQT as tqt

# Temperature-dependent physics
kT_300K = tqt.temperature_to_thermal_energy(300)  # 0.0259 eV
f = tqt.fermi_dirac(0.1, 0.0, kT_300K)  # Fermi occupation
